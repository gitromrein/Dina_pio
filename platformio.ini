[platformio]
; This is the root directory of the STM32CubeIDE project. Platformio can only
; take one source directory, thus we filter the sources using a
; source filter and additional build options to include the headers.
; This is set in the script and changing it here has no effect
src_dir = Core/Src
; The project headers are defined here to be available for the libraries as well
; This is no longer needed. Do not set it.
